# Docker Auto Backup üì¶

Docker Auto Backup is a lightweight, Rust-based automatic backup generator designed for seamless integration with cloud providers such as [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive) and [BackBlaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage).

## Available Cloud Providers üåê

As of now, Docker Auto Backup supports [BackBlaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage), and I'm actively working on implementing [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive).

## Motivation üå±

I'm currently on a Rust-learning journey and have recently acquired a Raspberry Pi 5 for hosting various services using Docker within my home. The motivation behind this project is to create a cloud-backup system capable of generating encrypted backups and automatically uploading them.

Then, I chose to incorporate Rust into this project as a means of self-improvement. However, the tasks of generating and encrypting backups are currently handled by bash scripts. My decision to use bash was driven by the belief that working with binaries is more straightforward in bash than in Rust. Presently, only the upload process is implemented using Rust.

Given my newcomer status in Rust, I welcome pull requests for both incorporating best practices and implementing future improvements.

## How the System Works üõ†Ô∏è

We use Docker containers to run this project, following these steps:

1. A designated backup folder, typically `/backup`, serves as the repository. Whatever data we want to back up must be mounted to this folder, like so:
    ```yaml
    services:
      app:
        ...
        volumes:
          - /path/to/data/we/want/to/backup:/backup/service-1:ro
    ```

2. Firstly, our Rust application spawns a `temp` folder, an identical copy of the `/backup` folder, for both compression and encryption purposes.

3. Then, we employ `tar` to combine all files and folders into a single binary.

4. Following that, we utilize `zstd` to compress the tar file.

5. Post-compression, we employ `gpg` to encrypt the compressed tar file.

6. The next stop involves uploading the encrypted compressed tar file to cloud providers like [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive) and [BackBlaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage).

7. To wrap things up, a cleanup process is initiated, tidying up the aftermath of the backup generation.

This entire sequence of operations is automated through cronjobs.

## Deploying üöÄ

Follow these steps to deploy Docker Auto Backup:

1. Clone the repository to the machine (referred to as the server later) you want to deploy:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:BUR4KBEY/docker-auto-backup.git
    cd docker-auto-backup
    ```

2. Build the image:
    ```bash
    docker build . -t docker-auto-backup-generator
    ```

3. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file elsewhere on your system:

    ```yml
    version: "3"
    services:
      app:
        image: docker-auto-backup-generator
        container_name: docker-auto-backup
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
          BACKUP_FOLDER_PATH: /backup # optional, you must mount to /app/backup if you don't set
          BACKBLAZE_KEY_ID: ${BACKBLAZE_KEY_ID}
          BACKBLAZE_APPLICATION_KEY: ${BACKBLAZE_APPLICATION_KEY}
          BACKBLAZE_BUCKET_REGION: ${BACKBLAZE_BUCKET_REGION}
          BACKBLAZE_BUCKET_NAME: ${BACKBLAZE_BUCKET_NAME}
          GPG_RECIPIENT: ${GPG_RECIPIENT}
          # CRON_SYNTAX: '0 4 * * *' # optional, default value is provided
          # RUN_AT_STARTUP: false # optional, default value is provided
          # DO_NOT_CLEANUP: false # optional, default value is provided
          # ZSTD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL: 19 # optional, default value is provided, min 1, max 22
        volumes:
          - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
          - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
          - ../service-1/data:/backup/service-1:ro # /backup must be same as environment.BACKUP_FOLDER_PATH
          - /path/to/things_should_be_backed_up:/backup/things:ro
          - ./gpg:/gpg:ro
    ```

    Additionally, if you prefer not to expose sensitive information directly in the compose file (recommended), create a `.env` file as follows:

    ```
    BACKBLAZE_KEY_ID=""
    BACKBLAZE_APPLICATION_KEY=""
    BACKBLAZE_BUCKET_REGION=""
    BACKBLAZE_BUCKET_NAME=""
    GPG_RECIPIENT=""
    ```

    Obtain your [BackBlaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage) credentials by following the instructions [here](https://www.backblaze.com/apidocs/introduction-to-the-s3-compatible-api).

    Generate a GPG key on your local machine (referred to as the host machine later). For details, a quick search should guide you. Then, put your **GPG Key ID** into the `GPG_RECIPIENT` environment variable.

    Export your GPG key's public key, create a folder named `gpg` inside the compose file's directory, and place your `public_key.gpg` file into that folder. The name is arbitrary and does not matter.
  
  4. Deploy the stack:
      ```bash
      docker compose up -d
      ```

      The application should now be operational. You can test it by either setting the `RUN_AT_STARTUP` environment variable to true and checking the logs with the command `docker-compose logs app -f`, or you can execute the following command to test:

      ```bash
      docker compose exec -it app /app/docker-auto-backup
      ```

## Development üîß

Setting up your Rust development environment is pretty standard. However, to streamline the process and spare you from constantly running the `cargo run` command with a slew of environment variables, you can use `./dev.sh`.

To set it up:

1. Copy the `dev.example.sh` file and rename it to `dev.sh`.

2. Provide the necessary environment variables in `dev.sh` based on your preferences. 

3. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x dev.sh
    ```

## Unpacking the Encrypted Backup üîê

Imagine you've downloaded a backup, and now you're ready to unpack it. Sure, you could type a bunch of commands, but here's a simpler way:

Run the `./unpack_backup.sh backup_file.tar.zst.gpg` script on your host machine. You'll be prompted to enter your passphrase. Once done, you should find a `backup` folder in your current working directory.
